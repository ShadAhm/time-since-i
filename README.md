## Why it was made

Primary reason was just to learn React.

And also I use an app on my phone for tracking how long it has been since I quit smoking. But as an aspiring (and failing a lot!) vegetarian, I also want to keep track of how long it has been since I last ate meat. Most app I found only allow keeping track of the one thing, so I had to install 2 quit-smoking apps just to do this. Therefore this app can handle multiple count-ups.
