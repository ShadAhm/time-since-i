# time-since-i
Simple React site for showing you how long it's been since you've done something. 

PWA - can be installed as an app and will work offline.

## Why it was made

Primary reason was just to learn React.

Second, I needed an app that could track multiple count-ups for different goals. For example, I quit smoking a while ago and I use an app to see how long I have been smoke-free. I also try to (very often failing) follow a vegetarian diet. I wanted an app that could show me how long it has been since I ate meat as well. Most of the apps I found were designed for only one count-up, so I decided to make my own app that could handle multiple ones.

## âš  Caution: data is not persisted

If you're using this app I thank you! But please take note that the data is only persisted on your LocalStorage, as there's no backend and no database persisting your data. So don't use this app unless you also have your stuff written down somewhere else, or if it's unimportant.
