## Why it was made

Primary reason was just to learn React.

Second, I needed an app that could track multiple count-ups for different goals. For example, I quit smoking a while ago and I use an app to see how long I have been smoke-free. I also try to (very often failing) follow a vegetarian diet. I wanted an app that could show me how long it has been since I ate meat as well. Most of the apps I found were designed for only one count-up, so I decided to make my own app that could handle multiple ones.
